    <h1 class="project-title">PlotGrid – Visual Plot Mapping for Writers</h1>

    <p class="project-sub">
      A colorful web tool for mapping characters, events, conflicts, and settings on a shared grid,
      helping writers see their stories as connected systems instead of scattered notes.

      <p>
        PlotGrid started as a thought experiment: what if outlining a novel felt more like
        arranging a constellation than editing a bulleted list? I designed and built a
        prototype interface where writers drag nodes representing
        <strong>characters, events, conflicts, and settings</strong> onto a shared grid,
        then connect them with visible relationship lines.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UI is inspired by sticky notes, index cards, and crime-board diagrams, but reimagined
        for the browser. Each node is color-coded by type and placed on a soft grid, while connectors
        reveal how plot threads intersect and depend on each other.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Visual grid of story elements (characters, events, conflicts, settings)</li>
        <li>Color-coded nodes with short, readable titles for each plot point</li>
        <li>Connector lines that make relationships between scenes and characters explicit</li>
        <li>Concept support for AI-powered critique of structure, pacing, and stakes</li>
        <li>Built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a focus on clean, writer-friendly UX</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        PlotGrid is designed for novelists, game writers, and storytellers who think spatially.
        Instead of hiding structure inside documents, it pulls everything onto one canvas to
        surface patterns, gaps, and overloaded sections at a glance.
